It is my first code after taking python courses. I wanted to do a simple tool where I could try basics of python like loops, functions, list, dictionaries etc.
I decided to do a game similiar to polish tv show Wheel of Fortune(Ko≈Ço fortuny) where you guess letters in a sentence and then you guess a full sentence.
The hardest challenge there was creating a code to store a sentence and guessed letters, so we could see it in a format of "_" for each hided letter and show a letter if guessed correctly.
I used two seperate dictionaries, one to store hided word with "_" for each letter and second dictionary used for comparision in a loop and if statement. 
When I finished my code I asked ChatGPT for suggestion so my code could be cleaner. Repo contains a code in python and an excel file that stores sentences used in a tool.
