It is my first code after taking python courses. I wanted to do a simple tool where I could try basics of python like loops, functions, list, dictionaries etc.
I decided to do a game similiar to polish tv show Wheel of Fortune(KoÅ‚o fortuny) where you guess letters in a sentence and then you guess a full sentence.
The hardest challenge there was creating a code to store a sentence and guessed letters, so we could see it in a format of "_" for each hided letter and show a letter if guessed correctly.
I used two seperate dictionaries, one to store hided word with "_" for each letter and second dictionary used for comparision in a loop and if statement. 
When I finished my code I asked ChatGPT for suggestion so my code could be cleaner. Repo contains a code in python and an excel file that stores sentences used in a tool.

Project Description:
I developed a Python-based game inspired by "Wheel of Fortune," where players guess a hidden phrase by selecting letters. The project integrates game logic, data handling, and file management.It is my first python project after taking python courses. I wanted to do a simple tool where I could try basics of python like loops, functions, list, dictionaries etc.

Key Features:
âœ… Random phrase selection from a text file, allowing easy expansion of the phrase database.
âœ… Incorrect guess limit â€“ players have a restricted number of attempts, adding challenge to the game.
âœ… Scoring system â€“ points are awarded for correct guesses.
âœ… Dynamic phrase updates â€“ revealed letters are displayed, while unrevealed ones remain hidden.

Technologies Used:
ðŸŸ¢ Python â€“ core programming language
ðŸŸ¢ Excel file (.xlsx) â€“ storing the phrase database
ðŸŸ¢ Loops and conditions â€“ implementing game logic

Achievements:
âœ… Developed a fully functional Python game, enhancing skills in input handling and algorithms.
âœ… Applied string manipulation techniques and interactive user input processing.
âœ… Potential for further expansion, including a graphical user interface or database integration.

To be added:
#Receive cash for each letter correctly guessed.
#Don't allow sentences to repeat in one round
#Add multiplayer
#Add polish letters
