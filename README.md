**Project Description:
**
I developed a Python-based game inspired by "Wheel of Fortune," where players guess a hidden phrase by selecting letters. The project integrates game logic, data handling, and file management.It is my first python project after taking python courses. I wanted to do a simple tool where I could try basics of python like loops, functions, list, dictionaries etc.

Key Features:

âœ… Random phrase selection from a text file, allowing easy expansion of the phrase database.

âœ… Incorrect guess limit â€“ players have a restricted number of attempts, adding challenge to the game.

âœ… Scoring system â€“ points are awarded for correct guesses.

âœ… Dynamic phrase updates â€“ revealed letters are displayed, while unrevealed ones remain hidden.

Technologies Used:

ðŸŸ¢ Python â€“ core programming language

ðŸŸ¢ Excel file (.xlsx) â€“ storing the phrase database

ðŸŸ¢ Loops and conditions â€“ implementing game logic


Achievements:

âœ… Developed a fully functional Python game, enhancing skills in input handling and algorithms.

âœ… Applied string manipulation techniques and interactive user input processing.

âœ… Potential for further expansion, including a graphical user interface or database integration.


To be added:

ðŸŸ¢ Receive cash for each letter correctly guessed.

ðŸŸ¢ Don't allow sentences to repeat in one round

ðŸŸ¢ Add multiplayer

ðŸŸ¢ Add polish letters
